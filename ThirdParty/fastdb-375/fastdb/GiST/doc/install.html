<H2>Portability</H2>

<P>libGiST was concurrently developed under HP/UX with the g++ compiler,
and under Windows NT with the Microsoft Visual C++ 4.1 compiler. It is
also reported to have ported cleanly under Solaris with g++.  Since
these platforms are quite different, we expect the code to be quite portable,
but have not done extensive porting ourselves. Before you port libGiST
to other platforms, please check the <A HREF="http://s2k-ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/pub/gist/libgist/">libGiST
home page</A> and see if anyway has done it for you already. If not, and
you succeed in porting, contact us at <A HREF="mailto:gist@postgres.berkeley.edu">gist@postgres.berkeley.edu</A>!</P>

<H2>NT&nbsp;Installation Notes</H2>

<H3>Requirements</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Either an unzip package, or tar and gunzip. All of these are widely
available on the web.</LI>

<LI>Microsoft Visual C++ version 4.1: earlier versions may work, but we
make no guarantees</LI>

<LI>Microsoft Developer Studio: not strictly necessary, but you will have
to create your own NMAKE files if you don't have Developer Studio</LI>

<LI>bison &amp;&nbsp;flex: not actually required for libGiST, but necessary
to use the demonstration code. bison and flex for Windows are freely available
on the Web from a variety of sources.</LI>
</UL>

<H3>Procedure</H3>

<OL>
<LI>Run the genparse.bat script in the topmost directory.</LI>

<LI>Load libGiST\libGiST.mdp into Developer Studio. You probably want to
build both the Debug and Release configurations.</LI>

<LI>For each demo project of interest, there is a .mdp file in the directory
that can be loaded into Developer Studio to build the demo applications.</LI>

<LI>Libraries and executables will be left with their sources. &nbsp;If
you wish to install them elsewhere, you will need to do so by hand.</LI>
</OL>

<H2>UN*X Installation Notes</H2>

<H3>Requirements</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Either an unzip package, or tar and gunzip. All of these are widely
available on the web.</LI>

<LI>g++ version 2.7.2: other versions may work, as may other C++ compilers,
but we have not tested any.</LI>

<LI>gmake: you may substitute make, but will need to rewrite the (simple)&nbsp;Makefiles
to suit.</LI>

<LI>bison &amp; flex: not actually required for libGiST, but necessary
to use the demonstration code. bison and flex are freely available on the
Web from a variety of sources. It is possible that yacc and lex may be
substituted, but we have not tested them.</LI>
</UL>

<H3>Procedure</H3>

<OL>
<LI>Edit the top-level Makefile, and set paths for the various tools, etc.
</LI>

<LI>Run gmake -- it will recursively make libGiST and all the example projects.</LI>

<LI>Libraries and executables will be left with their sources. &nbsp;If
you wish to install them elsewhere, you will need to do so by hand.</LI>
</OL>
